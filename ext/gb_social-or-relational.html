            <h2>Social / Relational Bullying</h2>
            <h3><strong>“They Hurt You Without Ever Touching You.”</strong></h3>
            <p>This is the kind of bullying that doesn’t shout — it whispers. It hides in group chats, fake smiles, and subtle exclusions. It’s when people turn others against you, freeze you out, or ruin your reputation quietly — like cowards.</p>
            <p><strong>Relational bullying is manipulation disguised as popularity.</strong> It’s not about bruising your body. It’s about isolating you, erasing you, making you feel like you don’t belong — like you’re the problem.</p>
            <p>But here’s what they don’t want you to realize: <strong>they need the crowd. You don’t.</strong> Their power is borrowed. Yours? It’s real — and once you stop seeking approval, you become untouchable.</p>

            <h3><strong>Why Do They Do This?</strong></h3>
            <ul class="hidden_div_ul_1">
                <li><strong>Fear of being alone</strong><br>
                    They think pushing you out will protect their place in the group.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Insecurity</strong><br>
                    You stand out — and that scares them. So they try to make you stand alone.</li>

                <li><strong>Control through silence</strong><br>
                    They hope you won’t speak up, because exposing them means losing their grip.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></h3>
            <ul class="hidden_div_ul_2">
                <li><strong>Find your real people</strong> – connection isn’t about quantity, it’s about quality.</li>
                <li><strong>Don’t chase the crowd</strong> – if they need you to shrink, they’re not worth it.</li>
                <li><strong>Expose the pattern</strong> – name the behavior. Quiet manipulation thrives in shadows.</li>
                <li><strong>Own your narrative</strong> – build your story outside their little circle.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="final_thought"><strong>Final Thought</strong><br>
                Social bullying wants to make you question your worth. But the moment you realize that exclusion says more about them than you, <strong>you start choosing yourself — loudly, unapologetically, powerfully.</strong>
