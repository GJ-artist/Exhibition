            <h2>Cyberbullying</h2>
            <h3><strong>“They Hide Behind Screens Because They Can’t Face You.”</strong></h3>
            <p>Cyberbullying is the digital version of a hit-and-run. It’s fake accounts, cruel messages, public humiliation, and constant stalking — all from behind a screen. The internet gives cowards a megaphone and a mask. They say things online they’d never dare to say to your face.</p>
            <p><strong>It’s not “just online.” It’s real. It hurts. And it spreads.</strong> But it’s also trackable, exposable, and—most importantly—<em>temporary</em>.</p>
            <p>What cyberbullies fear the most? <strong>You not reacting.</strong> You thriving anyway. You turning the spotlight back on them, calmly and powerfully.</p>

            <h3><strong>Why Do They Do It?</strong></h3>
            <ul class="hidden_div_ul_1">
                <li><strong>False sense of power</strong><br>
                    Anonymity makes them bold. But behind that username? Still insecure. Still weak.
                </li>

                <li><strong>They want a reaction</strong><br>
                    Fear, sadness, anger — any sign that they got to you. Don’t give them the satisfaction.</li>

                <li><strong>Herd mentality</strong><br>
                    Online mobs form fast. Most don’t even know you — they just want something to attack.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></h3>
            <ul class="hidden_div_ul_2">
                <li><strong>Block, mute, report</strong> – every time. You don’t have to debate with cowards.</li>
                <li><strong>Screenshot and document</strong> – receipts speak louder than rumors.</li>
                <li><strong>Tell someone you trust</strong> – silence protects the bully, not you.</li>
                <li><strong>Take digital breaks</strong> – protect your peace, reclaim your mind.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="final_thought"><strong>Final Thought</strong><br>
                Cyberbullies are loud online but empty in real life. Your worth isn’t defined by likes, comments, or cruel DMs. <strong>You don’t need to delete yourself — you need to delete their access.</strong>
