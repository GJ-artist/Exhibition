            <h2>Physical Bullying</h2>
            <h3><strong>“Pain Is Temporary — But So Is Their Power.”</strong></h3>
            <p>Physical bullying is the most visible form of abuse — hitting, pushing, stealing, intimidation through size or strength. It’s aggressive, obvious, and often tolerated far longer than it should be because people say, “Boys will be boys” or “Toughen up.” No. Let's stop excusing violence.</p>
            <p><strong>Physical bullying is a performance.</strong> It’s the bully’s way of saying, “Look how powerful I am,” while secretly screaming, “I feel powerless inside.” People who use their fists usually don’t know how to use their minds — or emotions. So they lash out.</p>
            <p>But you? You don’t have to stay in their play. <strong>You don’t have to shrink to survive.</strong> You can protect yourself — and still walk with your head high.</p>

            <h3><strong>Why Does This Happen?</strong></h3>
            <ul class="hidden_div_ul_1">
                <li><strong>They feel small</strong><br>
                    So they try to make others feel even smaller.
                </li>

                <li><strong>They think pain equals power</strong><br>
                    Somewhere, they learned that violence = dominance. It doesn’t.</li>

                <li><strong>Lack of consequences</strong><br>
                    Many bullies only stop when someone finally says, “That’s enough.”</li>
            </ul>

            <h3><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></h3>
            <ul class="hidden_div_ul_2">
                <li><strong>Tell someone immediately</strong> – this is not “snitching.” It’s self-defense.</li>
                <li><strong>Stay around allies</strong> – bullies thrive in isolated corners. Don’t give them one.</li>
                <li><strong>Learn self-defense</strong> – not for revenge, but for protection and confidence.</li>
                <li><strong>Push for accountability</strong> – demand that schools, workplaces, or institutions step in.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="final_thought"><strong>Final Thought</strong><br>
                Physical bullies want to break your spirit by bruising your body. But your real strength? <strong>Isn’t in your fists. It’s in your ability to rise, protect yourself, and keep walking — unshaken.</strong>
