            <h2>Psychological / Emotional Bullying</h2>
            <h3><strong>“They Won’t Hit You, But They’ll Break Your Soul.”</strong></h3>
            <p>Emotional bullying doesn’t always leave bruises — it leaves scars on your heart and mind. It’s the gaslighting, the constant criticism, the manipulation that makes you question your worth, your decisions, and even your reality. They make you feel crazy, and make sure it’s you who doubts yourself, not them.</p>
            <p><strong>Psychological bullies are experts at twisting your reality.</strong> They make you feel worthless, unstable, and like you're always in the wrong. Their goal is to break your sense of self, so you’ll depend on them to feel whole again. But the truth? <strong>Your strength is your mind. And they want to control that because they fear it.</strong></p>

            <h3><strong>Why Do They Do It?</strong></h3>
            <ul class="hidden_div_ul_1">
                <li><strong>Power and control</strong><br>
                    They want you to feel like you need them. Because if you believe you're nothing without them, they hold all the cards.</li>

                <li><strong>Insecurity</strong><br>
                    They hurt you because they’re hurting, and making you feel small helps them feel big.</li>

                <li><strong>Manipulation</strong><br>
                    Emotional bullies twist your words, your actions, and even your intentions to make you doubt yourself.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></h3>
            <ul class="hidden_div_ul_2">
                <li><strong>Trust your gut</strong> – if something doesn’t feel right, it’s not. Stop questioning yourself.</li>
                <li><strong>Set boundaries</strong> – no one has the right to control your emotions or manipulate your thoughts.</li>
                <li><strong>Document the behavior</strong> – keeping track of their actions will protect you when they try to gaslight you into believing it’s all in your head.</li>
                <li><strong>Get support</strong> – emotional abuse thrives in isolation. Seek trusted friends, therapy, or a mentor to rebuild your confidence.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="final_thought"><strong>Final Thought</strong><br>
                Emotional bullies want you to believe their lies about you. But the truth? <strong>You are not broken. You are not weak. You are whole — and only you have the power to define your worth.</strong>
