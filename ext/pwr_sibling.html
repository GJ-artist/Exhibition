            <h2>Problems With Siblings</h2>
            <h3><strong>“Being Related Doesn’t Mean Being Respected.”</strong></h3>
            <p>Sibling conflict isn’t just teasing or rivalry. Sometimes, it’s dismissal, manipulation, emotional digs,
                or power games disguised as “normal family stuff.” When it affects your confidence, freedom, or peace —
                it’s a problem.</p>
            <p><strong>You're not wrong for wanting distance or fairness.</strong> Family doesn’t get a pass to hurt you
                just because they’ve known you longest. When a sibling constantly crosses lines, it’s not your job to
                keep the peace by sacrificing yourself.</p>
            <p>You don’t have to match their energy. But you also don’t have to keep absorbing it. <strong>Peace is not
                    passive — it’s protective.</strong></p>

            <h3><strong>Why Do They Act This Way?</strong></h3>
            <ul class="hidden_div_ul_1">
                <li><strong>Unresolved insecurity</strong><br>
                    They feel overlooked or less capable, so they attack you to level the field. It's not about you —
                    it's about how they see themselves.</li>

                <li><strong>Habitual roles</strong><br>
                    Family systems can lock people into outdated roles: “the golden one,” “the rebel,” “the failure.” If
                    your sibling sees you as a threat to their script, they’ll resist your growth.</li>

                <li><strong>Power and control</strong><br>
                    Especially in older siblings, control can masquerade as concern. But if you feel policed, judged, or
                    restricted — that’s not care. That’s control.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></h3>
            <ul class="hidden_div_ul_2">
                <li><strong>Set quiet boundaries</strong> – you don’t need their permission to protect your space.</li>
                <li><strong>Limit your exposure</strong> – peace grows in distance. Interaction should be earned, not
                    expected.</li>
                <li><strong>Stop explaining yourself</strong> – clarity isn’t for them; it’s for you.</li>
                <li><strong>Talk it out — if they’re ready</strong> – but don’t beg for growth they’re not ready to
                    give.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="final_thought"><strong>Final Thought</strong><br>
                You’re not cold, dramatic, or overreacting. <strong>Sometimes the healthiest thing you can do is unlearn
                    loyalty to pain — even if it’s wearing your sibling’s face.</strong>
