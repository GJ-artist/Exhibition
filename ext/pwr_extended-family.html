            <h2>Extended Family Issues</h2>
            <h3><strong>“Being Family Doesn’t Mean Being Entitled.”</strong></h3>
            <p>They might show up with smiles and small talk, but behind that? Judgment, overstepping, guilt-tripping — and a sense that you owe them something just because you share blood. Extended family drama hits differently. It’s distant, but somehow still invasive.</p>
            <p><strong>You’re allowed to say no.</strong> You’re allowed to keep your life private. Just because someone’s a cousin, aunt, uncle, or grandparent doesn’t mean they get access to your space, your time, or your mind.</p>
            <p>Not every family member is a safe one. <strong>Love doesn’t mean obedience. Respect doesn’t mean silence.</strong></p>

            <h3><strong>Why Do They Overstep?</strong></h3>
            <ul class="hidden_div_ul_1">
                <li><strong>Outdated traditions</strong><br>
                    In some families, boundaries weren’t taught — control was. They think closeness equals constant access, even if it hurts you.</li>

                <li><strong>Gossip as currency</strong><br>
                    For some, your life is entertainment. If they’re prying, it’s not out of concern — it’s fuel for stories.</li>

                <li><strong>Unresolved envy or ego</strong><br>
                    Sometimes they’re competing with your parents, with each other, or even with you — and you didn’t even enter the game.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></h3>
            <ul class="hidden_div_ul_2">
                <li><strong>Stay polite, but firm</strong> – you don’t need to explain your boundaries. You just need to hold them.</li>
                <li><strong>Limit access</strong> – protect your energy. Calls, visits, conversations — filter all of it.</li>
                <li><strong>Stop feeding guilt</strong> – if they manipulate through “family duty,” remember: real family doesn’t weaponize guilt.</li>
                <li><strong>Choose your circle</strong> – not every relative deserves a seat at your table. Blood isn’t a ticket to influence.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="final_thought"><strong>Final Thought</strong><br>
                Being related is biology. Being respectful is a choice. <strong>You are not selfish for protecting your peace — you’re wise for noticing who disrupts it.</strong>
