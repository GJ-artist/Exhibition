            <h2>In-Law Conflict</h2>
            <h3><strong>“You Married Your Partner — Not Their Entire Family.”</strong></h3>
            <p>They may act like they’re just trying to “help.” But somehow, their advice feels like control. Their
                presence feels like surveillance. And suddenly, your home isn’t just yours anymore — it’s a stage where
                you’re expected to perform.</p>
            <p><strong>In-law tension isn’t rare. But it’s also not something you have to silently endure.</strong>
                Boundaries don’t ruin relationships — they define them. If someone keeps crossing the line, the problem
                isn’t the line. It’s their refusal to respect it.</p>
            <p>Whether it’s passive comments, open criticism, or guilt-laced expectations, <strong>you are not obligated
                    to fold your life to fit their mold.</strong></p>

            <h3><strong>Why Do They Create Conflict?</strong></h3>
            <ul class="hidden_div_ul_1">
                <li><strong>Control disguised as concern</strong><br>
                    Some in-laws want influence over your choices — how you live, what you believe, even how you raise
                    kids — and they’ll mask it as “guidance.”</li>

                <li><strong>Unprocessed attachment</strong><br>
                    Parents may struggle to let go of their child and view you as “the reason” they’re losing control —
                    even if that’s not true.</li>

                <li><strong>Power plays</strong><br>
                    In some families, it’s a silent game of dominance. Who gets to decide? Who’s the favorite? It’s
                    immature, but very real.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></h3>
            <ul class="hidden_div_ul_2">
                <li><strong>Get on the same page with your partner</strong> – unity is your strongest defense. You don’t
                    have to agree with the in-laws, but you do need to back each other up.</li>
                <li><strong>Don’t take the bait</strong> – you’re not there to win arguments. You’re there to protect
                    your space and sanity.</li>
                <li><strong>Speak clearly and early</strong> – don’t wait until you're boiling. Boundaries work better
                    when set calmly, not during a blow-up.</li>
                <li><strong>Give space when needed</strong> – sometimes distance doesn’t destroy a relationship — it
                    saves it.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="final_thought"><strong>Final Thought</strong><br>
                Your home is not a courtroom. Your life is not a family debate show. <strong>Being firm isn’t disrespect
                    — it’s protection.</strong> You can love your partner without losing yourself to their family.
