            <h2>Workplace Bullying</h2>
            <h3><strong>“They Use Their Position to Crush Your Spirit.”</strong></h3>
            <p>Workplace bullying isn’t just the stuff of nightmares — it’s the quiet suffocation that happens when someone with more power makes your life miserable. It could be the boss who criticizes you for every little mistake, or the colleague who undermines you at every turn. It’s manipulative behavior designed to drain you of confidence and make you feel powerless.</p>
            <p><strong>Workplace bullies thrive on control.</strong> They know how to push buttons, spread rumors, and create an atmosphere of fear and self-doubt. And what makes it worse? They’re often given free rein because they’re in a position of authority. But that doesn’t mean you have to stay silent.</p>

            <h3><strong>Why Does This Happen?</strong></h3>
            <ul class="hidden_div_ul_1">
                <li><strong>Power dynamics</strong><br>
                    Some people feel threatened by your skills or potential, so they try to suppress you to maintain control.</li>

                <li><strong>Insecurity</strong><br>
                    They feel small and use bullying to inflate their egos and mask their own weaknesses.</li>

                <li><strong>Desire to isolate</strong><br>
                    By isolating you or tearing you down, they weaken your confidence and make it harder for you to stand up for yourself.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></h3>
            <ul class="hidden_div_ul_2">
                <li><strong>Document everything</strong> – keep a record of the bullying behaviors, dates, and any evidence you have (emails, messages, etc.).</li>
                <li><strong>Set boundaries</strong> – speak up when they cross the line. Let them know you won’t tolerate disrespect.</li>
                <li><strong>Speak to HR or management</strong> – don’t keep it to yourself. Report the behavior in a clear, calm, and factual manner.</li>
                <li><strong>Build your support system</strong> – find allies in the workplace who understand and can back you up. Isolation only strengthens the bully’s power.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="final_thought"><strong>Final Thought</strong><br>
                Workplace bullying thrives on silence and fear. When you raise your voice, build alliances, and hold your ground, <strong>you remind them that their power is not invincible — and neither are you.</strong>
