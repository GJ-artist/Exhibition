            <h2>Verbal Bullying</h2>
            <h3><strong>“They Can’t Touch You — So They Use Words.”</strong></h3>
            <p>Verbal bullying isn’t “just words.” It’s strategic. It’s calculated. It’s meant to cut deep — to create
                invisible wounds that last longer than bruises. People who use verbal abuse are often cowards who know
                they’d lose in any real confrontation, so they attack with what’s safe: their mouth.</p>
            <p>But here’s the truth: <strong>words only land when you believe them.</strong> The bully’s goal is to make
                you do the
                damage to yourself by internalizing their lies.</p>
            <p>These aren’t facts. These are reflections of their own self-loathing. They talk like that because deep
                down, they’re terrified someone will see who they really are — insecure, unoriginal, and powerless
                without their insults.</p>

            <h3><strong>Why Do Conflicts Happen?</strong></h3>
            <ul class="hidden_div_ul_1">
                <li><strong>Control</strong><br>
                    They feel invisible in their own life, so they try to control others with words.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Jealousy</strong><br>
                    You have something they don’t. Confidence. Creativity. Peace.</li>

                <li><strong>Testing Boundaries</strong><br>
                    They want to see how far they can push you — until you push back.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></h3>
            <ul class="hidden_div_ul_2">
                <li><strong>Don’t engage with their game</strong> – silence kills their ego.</li>
                <li><strong>Flip the script</strong> – respond with sharp comebacks or humor that confuses them.</li>
                <li><strong>Document everything</strong> if it’s happening at school or work – protect yourself legally.</li>
                <li><strong>Speak louder where it matters</strong> – build your voice where it makes real impact.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="final_thought"><strong>Final Thought</strong><br>
                Verbal bullies depend on your silence. The moment you <strong>stop shrinking and start owning your space,</strong> they lose their grip.
